###This study aims to predict the mechanical properties of Lego-inspired reconfigurable modular blocks. Load carrying capacity, stiffness are important features of this structural element. On the other hand, there is no predictive model that can accurately predict the load capacity of Lego-inspired reconfigurable modular blocks. Hence, this study wants to utilize sequential surrogate model to predict the load capacity of modular blocks using the generated data using finite element analysis.
