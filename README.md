###This study aims to predict the mechanical properties of Lego-inspired reconfigurable modular blocks. Load carrying capacity, stiffness are important features of this structural element. On the other hand, there is no predictive model that can accurately predict the load capacity of Lego-inspired reconfigurable modular blocks. Hence, this study wants to utilize sequential surrogate model to predict the load capacity of modular blocks using the generated data using finite element analysis.
In this study, a dataset was generated using the hypercube sampling method and finite element analysis. With the sampled input variables, the output variables were obtained from the high-fidelity finite element models. The established dataset was divided into two sub-sets, which were used to train and validate the surrogate models, respectively. Then, a sequential Surrogate model for property prediction is adopted to predict Load carrying capacity of modular blocks. 
The coefficient of determination R2 values for predicting the load capacity, is more than 0.97%. The convergence root mean squared errors (RMSE) for predicting the load capacity is less than 5 kN, as evaluated using the validation datasets. Therefore, the R2 more than 0.97% shows that the trained model can accurately predict the load capacity of Lego-inspired reconfigurable modular blocks.
